## 📖 About the Project

WordPad Installer was created to bring back the classic **WordPad** text editor to systems where Microsoft has removed it.  
It offers both a **full installation** and a **portable edition**, allowing you to choose between permanent installation or temporary use without leaving traces.

Features include:

- 📂 Copies WordPad executable & language files to `C:\Program Files\WordPad`
- 🖥️ Creates Start Menu shortcut
- 🗑️ Includes “Uninstall WordPad” shortcut
- 🧹 Cleans up installation files
- 💼 Portable edition runs without admin rights and removes itself after use
